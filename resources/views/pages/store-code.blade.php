                                In certain heightened or intoxicated states, however, this complacent
                                fallacy quickly falls apart.
                                One may be tempted to wave away these states of consciousness as articially
                                induced chemical reactions.
                                But everything in our brain is a chemical reaction, the so-called normal
                                state of mind being simply the
                                defaultor factory condition. In any case one does not need to ingest
                                anything dubious to achieve the
                                same results. This is often true also of certain soliditary spaces. A cave,
                                a cell, a dungeion.
                                All these confined spaces have one thing in common. By severely restricting
                                freedom of movement, they
                                take on the ominous character of a claustrophobic universe closing in on you
                                with its inescapable iron
                                laws. Here you do not have the luxury of agreement with the world and its
                                clloective thinking.
                                The majority and their reality (if they even exist) are the enemy. This is a
                                space either of sheer madness
                                and creativity or sufffocation and slow death. This is the labyrinthine
                                unreal where the mind becomes a twisted
                                extension of space, exerting an irresistible pull upon the chance visitor,
                                but with its lurking dangers also-one
                                cannot pierce its secrets without first opening up to the same abyssal
                                descent.
